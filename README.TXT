On-line Sales Portal- (Semester Project)

This software system was designed, using Software Engineering Principles, to provide a one-stop
online store for the users to buy and sell at the same platform. The system was built and
developed in Java platform, using the Java Swing interface, and MySql database management
system (DBMS). The consumers were facilitated to search, buy, sell, ‘add to Wishlist‘ (in case of
unavailability) the items of their interests. The system also supports consumer accounts and on-
line payments for the transactions (i.e. the interface supported all the functionalities). They were
also facilitated to give feedbacks and names of new items of their own desire, which helped the
manager to conduct and manage the portal in the advantage of the consumers. Message passing
among the buyers, senders and the manager, with Email facility was also incorporated, and all
the data, messages, transaction histories were stored safely using the MySql DBMS.

BUILD OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
========================

When you build an Java application project that has a main class, the IDE
automatically copies all of the JAR
files on the projects classpath to your projects dist/lib folder. The IDE
also adds each of the JAR files to the Class-Path element in the application
JAR files manifest file (MANIFEST.MF).

To run the project from the command line, go to the dist folder and
type the following:

java -jar "OnlineSalesPortal.jar" 

To distribute this project, zip up the dist folder (including the lib folder)
and distribute the ZIP file.

Notes:

* If two JAR files on the project classpath have the same name, only the first
JAR file is copied to the lib folder.
* Only JAR files are copied to the lib folder.
If the classpath contains other types of files or folders, these files (folders)
are not copied.
* If a library on the projects classpath also has a Class-Path element
specified in the manifest,the content of the Class-Path element has to be on
the projects runtime path.
* To set a main class in a standard Java project, right-click the project node
in the Projects window and choose Properties. Then click Run and enter the
class name in the Main Class field. Alternatively, you can manually type the
class name in the manifest Main-Class element.
